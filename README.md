# ArenaGuard

Privacy-first competitive gaming platform powered by Zama FHEVM.

---

## Executive Summary

ArenaGuard enables fair, verifiable gaming competitions where match data and scoring remain encrypted during gameplay. Built on Zama's Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine (FHEVM), the platform processes game logic over encrypted inputs, revealing only final outcomes and leaderboard positions while keeping player strategies and intermediate states private.

**Core Innovation**: Homomorphic game state transitions ensure that even smart contract validators cannot see player moves or scores until results are finalized and made public.

---

## Problem Statement

Traditional gaming platforms face a fundamental privacy-security tradeoff:

| Challenge | Traditional Approach | ArenaGuard Solution |
|-----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Anti-cheat detection** | Client-side validation (exploitable) | Server-side FHE verification |
| **Result transparency** | Centralized servers (trust required) | On-chain verification with private inputs |
| **Strategy privacy** | All moves visible to observers | Encrypted moves, public results only |
| **Fair randomness** | Pseudo-random (predictable) | Cryptographic randomness from FHE operations |
| **Cross-platform verification** | Platform-specific anti-cheat | Universal on-chain proofs |

## Solution Architecture

```
┌─────────────────┐
│   Game Client   │
│  (Encrypt Move) │
└────────┬────────┘
         │ euint64 move
         ▼
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│   Zama FHEVM Smart Contract     │
│  ├─ Receive encrypted move      │
│  ├─ Compute game state (FHE)    │
│  ├─ Verify move validity        │
│  └─ Update encrypted scoreboard │
└────────┬────────────────────────┘
         │ Public events (no plaintext)
         ▼
┌─────────────────┐
│  Reveal Handler  │
│  (Finalize Round)│
└─────────────────┘
```

**Key Components:**
- **Encryption Layer**: Players encrypt moves using FHE public keys
- **FHEVM Contract**: Processes encrypted game logic without decryption
- **Reveal Mechanism**: Controlled decryption at round end with threshold key management
- **Verification Layer**: Anyone can verify final results against encrypted commitments

## User Stories

### As a Competitive Player

**Story 1: Private Match Strategy**
> "I want to practice advanced strategies without opponents analyzing my moves in real-time. ArenaGuard encrypts my moves until the match ends, allowing me to test tactics privately."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Moves submitted as encrypted values (euint64)
- Only match winner and final score visible during gameplay
- Full move history decryptable after match completion (optional privacy setting)

**Story 2: Verified Fair Play**
> "I need proof that match results weren't manipulated by a central authority. ArenaGuard publishes cryptographic proofs alongside results."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Every match produces a verifiable proof artifact
- Proofs can be validated by anyone using public match ID
- Invalid proofs cause match state rollback

---

### As a Tournament Organizer

**Story 3: Scalable Private Tournaments**
> "I want to host large tournaments without revealing bracket strategies or early elimination results that could influence later matches."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Brackets computed over encrypted scores
- Only advancing players revealed at each round
- Final standings published with full verifiability

---

### As a Spectator

**Story 4: Transparent Outcomes, Private Processes**
> "I want to verify that tournament winners are legitimate without seeing private match strategies that could be used for future competitions."

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Final leaderboards are public and verifiable
- Match replays available after decryption period
- Cryptographic guarantees that results match encrypted inputs

---

## Technical Specifications

### FHE Operations

**Encrypted Data Types:**
- `euint64`: Player scores, match statistics
- `euint32`: Move timestamps, round counters
- `ebool`: Move validity flags, match completion status

**Supported Operations:**
- Addition: `add(scoreA, scoreB)` → encrypted sum
- Comparison: `gt(scoreA, scoreB)` → encrypted boolean
- Conditional: `if_then_else(condition, valueA, valueB)` → encrypted selection

**Gas Optimization:**
- Batch operations to amortize FHE costs
- Cache repeated computations
- Use plaintext where privacy not required

### Smart Contract Interfaces

```solidity
interface IArenaGuard {
    // Submit encrypted move
    function submitMove(uint256 matchId, bytes calldata encryptedMove) external;
    
    // Process encrypted game state
    function processRound(uint256 matchId) external;
    
    // Reveal final results (requires threshold keys)
    function revealMatch(uint256 matchId, bytes calldata decryptionKey) external;
    
    // Verify match results
    function verifyMatch(uint256 matchId) external view returns (bool);
    
    // Get public leaderboard (post-reveal)
    function getLeaderboard(uint256 tournamentId) external view returns (Player[] memory);
}
```

## Deployment Matrix

| Network | FHEVM Support | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------------|--------|-------|
| Sepolia Testnet | ✅ Full | Active | Primary development environment |
| Mainnet (Future) | ✅ Planned | Pending | Requires additional audit |

**Recommended Configuration:**
- Minimum gas limit: 5M per match
- Recommended block confirmation: 3+ blocks before reveal
- Key rotation: Every 100 matches or 30 days

## Security Considerations

### Threat Model

| Threat | Mitigation |
|--------|-----------|
| Key compromise | Threshold key management, automatic rotation |
| Front-running encrypted moves | Commit-reveal scheme with time locks |
| Result manipulation | Public verification proofs, immutable contract |
| Replay attacks | Nonce-based move tracking, match expiration |
| DoS via expensive FHE ops | Gas limits, move rate limiting |

### Privacy Guarantees

- **Match-level privacy**: Opponents cannot see moves until reveal
- **Tournament-level privacy**: Bracket computations remain encrypted
- **Statistical privacy**: Aggregate statistics computed homomorphically
- **Post-match privacy**: Optional permanent encryption for practice matches

## FAQ

**Q: How does ArenaGuard ensure fair play without revealing moves?**  
A: Zama FHEVM allows smart contracts to verify move validity and compute game outcomes over encrypted data. Moves are checked for compliance with game rules without being decrypted, and only final results are revealed.

**Q: What happens if the decryption key is lost?**  
A: Keys are managed using threshold cryptography with multiple key holders. If a threshold number of key holders are available, matches can still be revealed. For critical matches, time-locked automatic reveal is available as a fallback.

**Q: Can I build custom games on ArenaGuard?**  
A: Yes! The platform provides SDKs and templates for developing FHE-based games. See the `examples/` directory for sample implementations.

**Q: How expensive are FHE operations?**  
A: FHE operations have higher gas costs than plaintext operations, but ArenaGuard uses batching and optimization techniques to keep costs reasonable. A typical match costs ~200k-500k gas depending on complexity.

**Q: Is ArenaGuard ready for production use?**  
A: The core technology is functional on testnets. Mainnet deployment will follow after additional security audits and community testing.
